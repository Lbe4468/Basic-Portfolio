For Jason and my TAs,

Questions:

1. I would love to know the correct method to creating each of the elements on m y HTMLs, as I feel that I didn't follow protocol correctly for everything. It's as if I pieced everything together so it kind of works, instead of creating everything so that it is supposed to fit together. Does that make sense? 

2. If I make my window smaller, some of the elements on the page go crazy and end up out of order. How do I make it so that everything adjusts correctly to the size of the window/browser? I assume this is a must nowadays with everyone accessing sites on mobile devices...

3. Is there a way to create a containing element so that everything inside it adjusts to fit as far as size, etc. For example, I feel that would have been helpful when creating the Portfolio HTML, with the main content section containing the boxes. 

4. Any other feedback and/or obvious errors you find please point me in the right direction! I feel like I have a decent grasp on the concepts, but lack the necessary knowledge of proper protocol. 

Thank you very much,

Luke
